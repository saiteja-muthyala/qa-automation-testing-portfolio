## ✅ Manual Testing

- Designed 100+ structured test cases
- Covered login, cart, checkout, session handling
- Built regression test suite
- Executed test runs and recorded results

---

## 🤖 Selenium Automation

Automation framework built using:

- Page Object Model (POM)
- Java + Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG execution
- Maven dependency management

Automated scenarios:

- Valid login
- Invalid login
- Cart functionality
- Checkout flow

mvn test

## 🌐 API Testing

API validation performed using Postman:

- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
- JSON response validation
- Status code verification
- CRUD workflow simulation

---

## ⚡ Performance Testing

Load testing executed using JMeter:

- Simulated concurrent users
- Measured response time
- Generated performance metrics

---

## 🗄 Database Validation

Basic backend validation using SQL queries to simulate:

- Data integrity checks
- Record verification
- Query-based validation

---

## 🐞 Defect Reporting

Structured defect documentation includes:

- Bug ID
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual result
- Severity & priority
- Environment details

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Project

To demonstrate hands-on QA engineering skills aligned with industry standards and prepare for real-world QA roles involving:

- Functional testing
- Automation testing
- API validation
- Performance testing
- Defect lifecycle management
